## MyStore Project

MyStore is an Angular application that allows users to view a list of available products to purchase, add them to a shopping cart, and ultimately complete the checkout process.

## Project Features

- Product list page, which displays the available products for the user to choose and add to their cart (in various quantities)
- Product details page, which displays more information about any particular product
- Shopping cart, which includes the products that the user has added to their cart
- Checkout form, which collects information about the user (e.g., name, address, payment details, etc.)
- Order confirmation page, which shows the outcome after the user completes the checkout process (i.e., submits the checkout form)
